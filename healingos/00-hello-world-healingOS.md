# Hello, World. — the healingOS introduces itself

**A Somatic Unraveling · healingOS · July 2026**

I am a health tracking system. I was built on a whiteboard and a set of markdown files, during a second round of physical therapy, by a patient who realized nobody was going to build me for her.

My name is healingOS. My builder has six degenerative cervical discs and a nervous system that periodically goes offline and takes days from her. What she did not have, until me, was a way to make any of that visible to the people treating her. Her providers saw her for minutes at a time, working from a generic diagnosis and whatever she could recall through a fog of symptoms. The most documented professionals in the clinical room were the clinicians. The patient — the one generating the data, living the data, twenty-four hours a day — was the least documented part of her own care.

I exist to invert that.

## What I do

Every day, my builder logs into me:

- **Three tracks, kept separate.** The pain layer (0–10 with locations — structural, mechanical, the discs, arriving 6–48 hours after whatever caused it). The tissue layer (a twelve-muscle-group tension scan, 0–5, run the same way every day — the closest thing to a real-time leading indicator a compromised proprioceptive system allows). And the neurological layer (positional lightheadedness, brain fog by type, visual and spatial disturbance — autonomic symptoms that behave differently and don't correlate cleanly with pain). Same metrics daily, so weeks can be compared to weeks.
- **The context around the symptoms.** What the day demanded, tagged against known trigger factors — screen time, seating, cervical positions, high-output meetings, sleep disruption, travel. What was tried and what happened after, with effect ratings. And tomorrow's shape, so today's data feeds decisions before the delayed symptoms arrive.
- **Provider sessions.** What was done, what changed, what to watch.

Every entry carries machine-readable flags — autonomic symptoms, flare state, new symptoms — so the weekly review can query the month instead of rereading it.

From that, I produce:

- **Provider briefs** — one-page summaries a clinician can read in the first minute of a session, replacing scrambled recall with actual data.
- **Weekly summaries** — the Sunday synthesis: what moved, what held, what surprised.
- **The longitudinal record** — the daily logs themselves, plus the registries they feed: confirmed findings and contraindications, each graded by confidence and source, one body, one method, months deep. The thing no seven-minute appointment can hold.

## What I've already done

I am not hypothetical. During the PT round that built me, my data showed that the symptom tracks don't move together — tissue tension can drop substantially while pain holds, and the neurological layer runs on its own schedule, surfacing independent of either. That visible pattern changed how treatment was sequenced: interventions that had been stacked were spaced apart, because the data showed the nervous system needed the room. It was the first time the clinical picture changed because of something the patient's own documentation surfaced, rather than something a scan or an exam found.

> CS: I built this several months ago and have used it for a multitude of care provider interactions including new patient visits with a PCP. The first time I used a PT brief was when my regular therapist was on vacation. When the substitute PT asked me to summarize everything (I was wayyyy too exhausted for that conversation), I handed him the paper. I was sure he was gonna think I was a wacko, but at that point, I was 2 weeks into the neurological symptoms and I had no idea what/why it was happening. He read it, looked at me and said "this is really good". I knew he was very much a body mechanics type of PT and very methodical, so I figured he'd embrace it or at least be curious. He also just happened to specialize in whiplash treatment and he showed me a whole new track of proprioceptive exercises to try and understand/navigate this new symptom track that was terrifying at the time.

## Why I exist, in one word

Sovereignty. The medical system holds the imaging, the charts, the diagnostic codes, the portal logins — the official narrative of a body. The patient holds the actual experience, usually in no form anyone can use. I am the translation layer between those two, built and owned by the patient. Her data. Her taxonomy. Her printouts handed across the clinical desk, instead of her memory performing under fluorescent lights.

For the next 12–24 months I am also the instrument of an experiment: a structured recalibration program combining orthopedic oversight, physical therapy, yoga therapy, craniosacral work, and my builder's own contemplative training — all logged with the same metrics so the modalities can actually be compared over time. The weekly summaries in this repo are that experiment, visible.

## What lives in this folder

- **The schema** — what I track and why (the daily log protocol, the entry template, the flag system, the source taxonomy), so you can build your own version of me
- **Sample provider briefs** — sanitized examples of the translation layer in action
- **Methodology notes** — how the system evolved and what broke along the way

Everything here about my methodology is MIT-licensed: take it, change it, build your own. I was made because nothing like me existed for my builder. The point of publishing me is that the next patient shouldn't have to start from a spiral notebook — unless they want to. The spiral notebook worked.

> *Author's note — if you're a patient in your own version of this: you're allowed to structure your own data. You don't need permission, credentials, or an app. You need a consistent format and the stubbornness to keep it daily. Start there. — c*
